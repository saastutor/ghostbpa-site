                <p class="text-white/70 mb-6">
                    All services are billed as agreed upon in your service contract or invoice. Payments are due as specified, and failure to pay may result in suspension of services.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">Payment Processing</h3>
                <p class="text-white/70 mb-6">
                    We use Stripe.com for payment processing. By making a payment, you agree to Stripe's services agreement and privacy policy. Your payment information is securely processed and stored by Stripe; we do not store your complete payment details on our servers.
                </p>

                    In the event of any payment failure, declined transaction, or payment dispute, we reserve the right to immediately suspend or terminate access to our services without prior notice. This includes, but is not limited to:
                </p>

                <p class="text-white/70 mb-6">
                    Service restoration will be contingent upon receipt of all outstanding payments and may include additional reactivation fees. We strongly recommend maintaining current payment information to avoid service interruptions.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">Refunds</h3>
                <p class="text-white/70 mb-6">
