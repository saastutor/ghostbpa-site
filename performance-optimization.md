# Performance Optimization Tasks

Don't make assumptions
Don't change content unless you ask first
Only focus on making non-destructive changes to optimize pagespeed insights for the google report

This is not about redesigning the site, it is about keeping it exactly the same from form and function while improving its innner workings.

If a task has been completed, check it off in this file.

## Notes
- All optimizations must be compatible with GitHub Pages limitations
- Changes should be implemented incrementally and tested thoroughly
- Each optimization should be documented with its impact on performance metrics
